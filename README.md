# KanetGames.Pulsar

This is an old Game Engine built with SFML.Net 2.0. Started in 2012, i decide to build it when XNA was abandoned by Microsoft. 
This engine was primary design to be a XPlatorm game engine. Development end in 2014 after 2 years of work but no game was made with it.

I retreive the code and push it to Github to have an archive of my work.
